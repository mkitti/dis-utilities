"""
Given a DOI, try to identify Janelia authors who don't have ORCIDs and correlate them with employees.

This script ignores the existing jrc_author metadata. It generates a new list of employee IDs,
and finally directly overwrites the previous jrc_author list.

If the author has an ORCID on the paper that isn't in our collection, this script will
create an ORCID record for that person. If appropriate, it will add an employee ID to
an existing ORCID record.

This script will not create new "employeeId only" records in the ORCID collection.

This script will not include anyone in jrc_author if they're not in the People system.
